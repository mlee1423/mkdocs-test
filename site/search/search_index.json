As the primary hub, it processes instructions that come from programs, the operating system, or other components in the computer. Not too long ago, these functions had to be split across multiple processors to be completed, but manufacturing and design improvements have made it so that the entire CPU can fit onto a single chip. CPUs work in sequence, which means that every instruction set processed can only be executed in order, one after another. This process happens in three stages: fetch, decode, execute. The CPU takes the instruction (fetches), processes it to be able to read it properly (decodes), and then executes it. Cores \u00b6 Originally, CPUs had a single core. Meaning that the physical CPU had just a single central processing unit on it. To increase performance, manufacturers add additional cores. Multicore processors are made up of two or more CPUs on a single chip. The individual cores can execute multiple instructions in parallel, which greatly increases software performance while multi-tasking. Info There are two major CPU manufacturers: Intel and AMD . Both companies frequently trade places for offering better value in terms of cores and threads, without sacrificing too much in the performance department. Threads \u00b6 graph TD A(Dual Core CPU) --- B(Core 1); A --- C(Core 2); B --- D(Thread 1); B --- E(Thread 2); C --- F(Thread 3); C --- G(Thread 4); For even greater performance enhancement, manufacturers Intel and AMD began using \"hyper-threading\" and \"simultaneous multithreading (SMT)\", respectively. A thread is a virtual version of a CPU core. A single CPU core can have up to two threads per core. While cores increase the number of tasks available to execute at one time, threads improve overall performance by being able to manage the task processes. Example Opening an application on a computer creates a thread to handle tasks associated with that particular application. Opening and running more applications creates more threads. graph LR A(Core 1) --- B(Execution Thread 1: Open Chrome Web Browser Application); A --- C(Execution Thread 2: Open Spotify Application); B --- D(Task Process 1: Accessing Home Page); B --- E(Task Process 2: Typing Web Address); B --- F(Task Process 3: Loading Web Page); C --- G(Task Process 1: Searching for Artist); C --- H(Task Process 2: Selecting Album); C --- I(Task Process 3: Playing Song); Sockets \u00b6 The CPU Socket is where the CPU is housed when installed onto the motherboard. Socket types are built into the motherboard and cannot be changed. Each pin is wired to communicate with a specific part of the system. Chipsets \u00b6 For a given CPU, there's often a choice of chipsets that support it. A chipset acts as the motherboard's communications center and traffic controller. It determines component compatibility, expansion options, and overclockability. Below is a table showing common CPUs, their socket type, and corresponding available chipsets. Processor Socket Chipsets Core i9/i7/i5/i3-12XXX LGA1700 Z690 Platform Core i9/i7/i5/i3-10XXX LGA1200 Z490/Z590 Platform Core i7/i5/i3/Pentium/Celeron LGA 1151 Z390 Platform Core X-Series Processor LGA 2066 X299 Platform AMD Ryzen AM4 B450/A320/X470/B550/X570 Platform AMD Ryzen Threadripper sTRX4 TRX 40 Platform Simply Put A socket determines if a CPU will physically fit and work on that motherboard while the chipset determines features and properties the board has. (e.g. A Z170 is the same socket type as H170, but only the Z board can overclock.) Overclocking \u00b6 In order to overclock a processor, the user intentionally increases the CPU operation frequency above the original stock specifications. Because the processor's frequency heavily impacts the effective computational speed of the CPU, the ultimate goal is to increase the frequency of the CPU in order to achieve faster performance. CPU Cooler \u00b6 CPUs produce a lot of heat. High temperatures can cause the system to shut down in order to protect important components, and may even cause permanent damage. Fans and heatsinks are therefore necessary in order to keep the CPU running cool. Info With the exception of some high-end CPUs, most boxed CPUs are bundled with a corresponding CPU cooler which can meet basic demands for heat dissipation. For better system performance, it is suggested to purchase a separate CPU cooler. Coolers can be classified in terms of heat dissipation medium into two types: liquid cooling and air cooling. Air coolers can be further classified into tower-style, downdraft, and updraft coolers, depending on their appearance and airflow direction. Consider the Following \u00b6 Coolers need to provide corresponding brackets, as bracket positioning may vary slightly depending on the socket on the motherboard. Each CPU cooler supports a different thermal design power (TDP), indicating the upper range of heat output that it can handle. More powerful CPUs need better coolers to ensure stable operation. Choose a cooler that fits the PC Case. Powerful coolers often have large heat sinks, so it is important to choose a cooler that can fit into the case without obstructing other components. Motherboard \u00b6 The motherboard, also called the mainboard, is a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that holds and allows communication between the components of a computer. This includes the processor, memory, graphics card, hard drive, as well as any specialty expansion cards. The motherboard also contains the computer's main I/O ports that connect the attached components to peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, webcams, speakers and more. Info The motherboard may have HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI or VGA ports driven by the integrated graphics GPU inside some processors. Dimensions \u00b6 Common motherboard sizes include: ATX (30.5cm x 24.4cm) Micro-ATX (24.4cm x 24.4cm) Mini-ATX (17cm x 17cm) Memory - RAM \u00b6 Random Access Memory (RAM) is used to load and run applications, respond to commands, or toggle between multiple programs. Memory is almost always being actively used by the PC's operating system. Different programs require different amounts of RAM, but regardless of the application, it's likely to use at least a small amount. Adding up over time, if too much RAM is being used at once, the applications currently being used will slow down severely. Capacity Comparison \u00b6 4GB 8GB 16GB 32GB+ Bare Minimum. Adequate only for word processing, e-mail, and web browsing Standard. Minimum required for gaming. Ideal for gaming and most systems and tasks Any kind of system intensive, workstation-grade tasks; programming, virtual machines, photo and video editing. GPU - Graphical Processing Unit \u00b6 A GPU, or graphics card, is an expansion card that fits into the PCI-e slot on the motherboard. It handles complex graphical instructions, computing images, textures and objects, and sends the result to one or more monitors. Tip Be sure to connect the monitor display cable to the correct display port. A common mistake PC builders make is connecting the monitor of choice to the motherboard's I/O ports instead of the GPU's I/O ports, leading to unexpectedly poor graphic display performance. Storage \u00b6 The PC's storage drive is where the operating system (OS) is installed and files are kept. The file system is what the OS uses to control how data is stored and retrieved. By separating data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified. Current PC Storage Options: Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Low Cost Mechanical Parts Easily Damaged Needs Power and SATA Data Cable Slow Read/Write Speeds Solid State Drive (SSD) High Cost Needs Power and SATA Data Cable High Read/Write Speeds m.2 Drive (m.2) High Cost Uses PCI-e Port on Motherboard (No Cables) High Read/Write Speeds PSU - Power Supply \u00b6 Power supply is important when building a PC, as it converts AC power into DC power for the CPU, motherboard, graphics card, and all peripherals. General guidelines are as follows: 500-600 Watts for a PC using the web and office apps. 650-850 Watts for a PC using any external GPU. Unsure? Check the GPU's power requirements for exact measurements. Energy Efficiency \u00b6 The 80 Plus certification program for power supply units offers 80 Plus, 80 Plus Bronze, 80 Plus Silver, 80 Plus Gold, 80 Plus Platinum and 80 Plus Titanium certification levels. The most efficient (and most expensive) Titanium tier offers more than 90% energy efficiency. Power Supply Design \u00b6 There are three types of PSUs on the market: Full Modular, Semi Modular, and Non Modular. Below is a table covering the different pros and cons between them. Full Modular Semi Modular Non Modular Air Flow Excellent air flow due to less cable clutter Good air flow with good cable management Bad air flow due to cable clutter Temperature Low temperature reading due to less cable clutter Fine temperature reading due to good air flow and cable management Poor cable management will result in high temperature Aesthetics Easy to organize and manage for good looks Good looks with decent cable management Messy looks due to too many cables Convenience Convenient PSU replacement Easier PSU replacement with less cables to unplug Need to remove all cables when switching PSU Customization Can be fully customized Limited customization options No customization options Warning If a motherboard that supports overclocking is purchased, it may require dual ATX 8 pin or 8+4 pin for the CPU. Check to make sure the selected power supply has them. Case \u00b6 Selecting a case can be done mostly to personal taste, but there are a few factors to keep in mind. The case needs to have good air flow, so there should be lots of fan mounting spots. Look for wide openings at the front for air to enter, and having them filtered will help keep dust out of the case. Check what size motherboard the case will accept, most motherboards are ATX sized and won't fit in smaller cases. Check the length of GPU the case accepts, as newer graphics cards can reach 27-33cm in length. Check the case for mounting spots for all storage devices. For air cooling, check the case's maximum CPU cooling height in millimeters, having at least a few mm more than the height of the actual cooler. For liquid cooling, the radiator needs a spot to mount to the case, so check for 240 or 360mm radiator mounting locations at the front or the top. The top is the recommended location for keeping the inside of the case cool as the radiator will exhaust directly outside the case. Danger Never mount the radiator to the bottom of the case. The pump should never be at the very top of a liquid loop as the small amount of air in the loop will want to pool there, reducing the efficiency of the CPU cold-plate and pump. Tempered glass panels show off the internals but add considerable weight, and care must be taken when transporting and after installation. Be cautious not to torque fasteners too tightly on the glass as over time this can cause it to shatter. Operating Systems \u00b6 An operating system is considered to be the backbone of any system. Without an operating system, the user and system cannot interact. The three most universally used operating systems are: Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Windows is developed by Microsoft and is comparatively the most accessible operating system on the market. MacOS is developed by Apple for their Macintosh systems and is geared towards users that want performance fused with simplicity. Linux is a free, open-source family of operating systems initially developed by Linus Torvalds and currently updated by the GNU Project and the Linux community. It is mainly used by enthusiasts and companies that run servers and applications with the need of high security and no downtime.","title":"Beginner's Introduction Guide to PC Building"},{"location":"1-pc/#beginners-introduction-guide-to-pc-building","text":"","title":"Beginner's Introduction Guide to PC Building"},{"location":"1-pc/#components","text":"Inside the case of every computer is the following: CPU CPU Cooler Motherboard Memory Graphics Card Storage PSU","title":"Components"},{"location":"1-pc/#cpu-central-processing-unit","text":"The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is one of the most important parts of any PC.
