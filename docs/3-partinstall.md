# PC Part Installation Guide

## Preparation


### Required Tools

- Screwdriver (magnetic preferred but not required)
- Scissors
- Zip Ties or Velcro Straps (some parts come with these, check the box beforehand)
- Non Conductive Surface for Assembly

### Part Check
If not done already, unbox all components and insure that all hardware, brackets, screws, and other accessories are present.

_______________________________________________
Once preparation is complete, move on to Step 1.

## Step 1 - CPU Installation
1. Unlatch lid of the CPU socket.
2. Line up the triangle notch printed on CPU with guiding triangle notch printed on socket. (usually in the bottom left corner)
3. Carefully insert CPU inside socket.

    !!! caution
        Be careful with CPU socket pins, they are quite fragile, any slight collision can bend the pins, which can cause function errors.

4. Ensure CPU proper placement and close the lid of socket to lock it onto the processor.

    !!! help "Hearing a nasty noise during installation?"
        There will be grainy, crunchy metallic noises during this process, as the pins of the CPU and socket are being tightly combined.  This is normal.

5. If the processor protective plate does not disengage after step 4, gently remove it.

_________________________________________________
!!! help "Still Unsure?"
    If ever unsure of installation method, consult the specific CPU manual for detailed instructions.

## Step 2 - Memory Installation
1. Press down on the lock/eject tabs on the ends of the memory socket.
2. Consult the memory module installation order outlined in the motherboard manual

    !!! caution
        **Do not skip this step!** The suggested sequence of which memory slots to be installed first differs greatly between motherboards and if done incorrectly can lead to issues during PC start up.

3. Push the modules down until an audible **click** is heard. The retention clips will be pushed upwards and lock the RAM into the module.

## Step 3 - M.2 Drive Installation
1. Move and fasten riser screws on the M.2 standoffs.
2. Take the drive and gently insert it into the connector at a 30 degree angle.
3. Push the drive down towards the standoff and secure it with the included screw.

    !!! Tip
        Sometimes the screw that secures the drive to the motherboard is not pre-installed. If it is not there, check the motherboard's packaging and accessories.

## Step 4 - CPU Cooler Installation
1. Mount the back-plate onto the back of the motherboard if there is one.
2. Apply a pea-sized drop of thermal paste onto the surface of the processor.

    !!! warning
        **Be mindful while performing this step.** Too little paste can cause poor contact while too much can cause excess paste to go into the socket.  

3. Connect CPU Fan Cable to the CPU Fan Header on the motherboard.
4. Lower the cooler vertically and place it onto the CPU. Secure it by evenly tightening opposite screws progressively.
    !!! info
        Make sure the screws are tightened properly, and the pressure applied at the corners is even to avoid CPU damage and cooling performance degradation.

## Step 5 - Motherboard Installation
1. Install I/O shield onto the back of the case.
2. Gently lower the motherboard at a 45 degree angle into the case.
3. Match the mounting holes on the motherboard with the stand-offs in the case.
4. Secure the board with each of the supplied screws.

## Step 6 - Storage Installation
1. Connect one end of the SATA cable to the SATA ports on the motherboard, and the other end to the storage device itself

!!! Tip
    Make sure you mount the hard drive tight to avoid damage.

## Step 7 - Graphics Card Installation
1. Remove rear PCI-e bracket from the case.
2. Unlock the PCI-e slot by pushing back the small plastic lock located at the rear of the slot.
3. While holding the card with two hands, lower it into the case and place it into the PCI-e slot of the motherboard.
4. Secure the graphics card with the required screws to the back of the chassis.

## Step 8 - Power Supply Installation
1. Mount the Power Supply (PSU) into the chassis and secure it with all screws.
2. Connect 24-pin power connector into the socket on the motherboard.
3. Connect 8-pin CPU power connector to the motherboard.
4. Connect 6+2 pin PCI-e Cable to graphics card (check GPU manual for details).
5. Clip in SATA power connector to hard drive.
6. Connect other Molex connectors (4 horizontal pins) to any extra devices.

## Step 9 - Front Panel Connectors and Cable Management
1. Connect Power Switch/Reset Switch/power LED/HDD LED Cable to motherboard JFP1 Pin header.
2. Connect front USB cables to USB pin headers on the motherboard.
      1. USB 3.0/USB 2.0 Cable to USB 3.0/USB 2.0 Pin header.
      2. Front USB Type-C Cable to Front USB Type-C Pin header.

## Step 10 - Operation System Installation

1. Prepare an 8 gigabyte or more USB thumb drive.
2. On a computer with internet, search “windows 10 media tool”, and download the
installation.
      1. Run the program.
      2. Choose to create the image on the USB and the program will format the drive.
3. Plug the installation USB in a motherboard rear USB port, choose a fast red USB3
port or normal USB3 with blue insert.
4. Turn on the computer, usually on first boot the BIOS will load, you can save and exit, restarting the PC. The USB should load and you can proceed with installation.

    !!! help "Not Working?"
        If the system can't be booted from the installation device, enter the BIOS and prioritize the boot sequence.
