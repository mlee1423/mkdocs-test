# PC Part Buying Guide

## Create Parts List

Now that all components and their purpose in the construction of a computer have been explained, it is now time to make a list of all the hardware planned to go into the build. To make this task less daunting, PCPartPicker will be used to assemble the part list. This site provides computer part selection, compatibility, and pricing guidance on all PC hardware that is available to order online and in-store.

Go to [pcparkpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) on your web browser and select the PC Builder tool on the navigation bar.
