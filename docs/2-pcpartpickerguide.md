# Beginner's Hardware Purchase Guide for PC Building

## Build Planning

### Purpose

When planning to build a personal computer, having a clear idea of the type of tasks it will be performing on a daily basis is paramount. A PC being used for gaming or video editing will have very different hardware requirements than a PC being used for occasional word processing and internet browsing.

### Budget
Having a budget in mind is of upmost importance when planning a PC build. Having to decide between performance and affordability is quite common for the average PC builder, so knowing limits before drafting a part list is always recommended.

Below is a table of cost ranges, the type of tasks computers built with that cost range can execute, and the primary component that influences performance on those tasks.

| Desktop      | Gaming    | Workstation|
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| $300-$800    |$900-$1,500| $1,600+   |
|   Web Browsing, Office Apps, Audio/Video Playback    | Gaming, Audio/Video Editing, Crypto Mining  | Audio/Video Encoding, Number Crunching, Virtual Machines, Databases|
| Single Core CPU Performance |  GPU Performance | Multi Core CPU and GPU Performance |

Once the budget and desired performance level has been decided, the part list can be created. To make this task less daunting, PC Part Picker will be used to assemble the part list. This site provides computer part selection, compatibility, and pricing guidance on all PC hardware that is available to order online right now.

## Creating the Part List

### PC Part Picker

#### Narrowing Product Options  
The following are three tools PC Part Picker provides that help manage which results are displayed.

    If a combination of specifications are selected that are not compatible, no results will return. Be sure to check the filter selection when getting undesired results.

### Compatibility Notes

Underneath the Part List, there is a **Compatibility Notes** section that discloses select information of each component that requires attention from the PC builder during construction.

![step5](./assets/images/pcppguide/step 5.png){: style="width:30em"}

Each letter in the Compatibility Note section corresponds to the same letter in the Motherboard Usage diagram (see section below), highlighting that specific component and giving visual context to the note.

#### Usage Diagram

Underneath the Compatibility Notes, a **Motherboard Usage** diagram is displayed to help identify which components from the list are filling what section of the motherboard. This can be useful for having a basic visualization of the interaction between the components and motherboard.
